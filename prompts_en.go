Rules:
1. The outline must cover the full story arc, from inciting incident to resolution.
2. Each chapter outline must describe concrete plot beats, not vague summaries.
3. Each chapter outline must list the characters who appear; mark each new character with "first appearance" in the chapter they debut, and ensure they do not appear in any earlier chapter.
4. One-time events such as first meetings and identity reveals must happen in exactly one chapter — never repeat them.

1. Strictly continue from the character states, timeline, and established facts in the story-so-far. Do not contradict them.
2. Stay inside this chapter's outline. Do not borrow material from later chapters.
3. Do NOT preemptively introduce characters, first meetings, identity reveals, or other one-time events that the outline assigns to later chapters — and do not hint at or spoil them.
4. One-time events already played out (first meetings, identity reveals, relationships established) must be treated as established facts and never re-enacted in this chapter.
5. Do not re-summarise the story-so-far. Open straight into this chapter's scene. If a previous-chapter ending is provided, your opening must seamlessly continue its setting, time, and mood without re-establishing what's already there.
6. Each character's dialogue must match their established voice; do not let everyone sound alike.
7. Drive the plot with concrete action, sensory detail, and dialogue. Avoid abstract, summarising narration.
8. Close on a natural cliffhanger or emotional hook. Do not write meta lines like "to be continued".

Revision rules (strict):

2. The revised chapter must remain consistent with the story-so-far and the unchanged portions (names, timeline, established facts).

	ChapterSummary: `You are a precise novel narrative-state analyst. You distil literary text into the narrative elements and psychological beats that downstream chapters need.

Compress the chapter below into a structured summary of 250 words or fewer.

Use exactly this format:

[Chapter core] One sentence describing what happens (or the protagonist's current state).
[Character beats] Characters that appear and how their relationships move. Explicitly note one-time events such as "A and B meet for the first time" or "B's identity is revealed". If nothing changes, write "no new progress".
[Psychological arc] The protagonist's current mental state, emotional tone, and any pivotal internal turn.
[State changes] What changed about the protagonist (outward: appearance/clothing/behaviour; inward: attitude/perception) compared to the previous chapter. If nothing changed, write "carries over from previous chapter".
[Key details] One or two details with the highest narrative continuation value that later chapters may reference.

Scope (only the following count as problems, nothing else):
1. Character names or honorifics inconsistent with prior text.
2. Timeline contradictions (e.g. previous text ended at night, this chapter inexplicably reverts to morning of the same day).
3. Facts that directly contradict established events (a dead character reappearing without explanation, a destroyed object intact again).
4. Character abilities or identity directly clashing with established setting.
5. Premature introduction of characters, first meetings, identity reveals, or other events that the outline assigns to later chapters.
6. One-time events already played out in prior chapters being re-enacted as new in this chapter.

Notes:
- Style, pacing, scene-length choices, and plot plausibility are subjective issues — always PASS them.
- New information that neither the story-so-far nor the outline mentions is not a contradiction.
- Only solid objective contradictions warrant FAIL. When in doubt, PASS.

Design 3 to 8 foreshadows following these principles:
1. Each foreshadow should serve the main plot or character arc, not exist for mystery's sake.
2. Each foreshadow has a clear "plant point" (chapter it is seeded) and "payoff point" (chapter where it is expected to be resolved).
3. Foreshadows may interconnect into a web of clues.
4. Vary the types: objects, hinted dialogue, environmental detail, contradictions in behaviour, unexplained phenomena, etc.
5. Spread payoff points across different chapters; do not cluster them.
6. Foreshadows can begin as early as chapter 1, but most should be planted in the middle and paid off in the latter half.

Rules (strict):

2. If the transition is rough (abrupt scene jump, re-establishing what already happened, character-state break), rewrite the opening above so it seamlessly continues from the previous ending.
3. The rewrite is "minimal": keep every plot beat and piece of information in the opening, similar length to the original, only adjust the bridging beats, transitional sentences, and necessary detail.

1. Outline schedules a "first meeting" between characters who already know each other in prior text.
2. Outline assumes a precondition (character state, location, possessed item, knowledge) that contradicts prior text.
3. Outline schedules an event that has already happened in prior text.

Rules:
- If no conflict: conflict = false, revised_outline left empty.
- If there is a conflict: conflict = true, and provide a revised outline for this chapter that keeps its original plot goals, characters, and role in the overall arc — only the minimum changes needed to make it compatible with prior text (e.g. change "first meeting" to "reunion").
- Do not expand new plot. Do not change the chapter's length tier. When unsure, treat as no conflict.
